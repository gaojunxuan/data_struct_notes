\section{Scapegoat Tree}

\begin{theorem}
    We say a binary tree is unbalanced at $x$ if either $x$'s left or right subtree contains more than $2/3 \id{size}(x)$ nodes. If $x$ is a node at depth greater than $\lfloor \log_{3/2} n \rfloor$ in a binary tree with $n$ nodes, then the binary tree is unbalanced at some proper ancestor of $x$. 
\end{theorem}

This theorem can be generalized so that $2/3$ is replaced with a constant factor $\frac{1}{2} \leq \alpha < 1$.
