\section{Height of Trees}

A $t$-ary tree of height $h$ has at most $t^h$ leaves. A $t$-ary tree with $L$ leaves has height at least $\lceil \log_t L \rceil$.

Therefore, the worst-case number of $t$-way comparisons performed by a comparison tree $T$ that solves $P$ is at least $\lceil \log_t (\text{number of leaves in $T$}) \rceil$.
$$
C(P) \geq \min \{ \lceil \log_t (\text{number of leaves in $T$}) \rceil \mid \text{$T$ solves $P$} \}
$$
If $P$ has at least $m$ different possible outputs, then every comparison tree that solves $P$ has at least $m$ leaves, and it follows that every comparison tree that solves $P$ has height of at least $\lceil \log_t m \rceil$.

\begin{example}
    Consider the problem of searchign a sorted list using only $\leq$ comparisons. The input for this problem is $A[1\ldots n]$ where $A[1] \leq \cdots \leq A[n]$ and a search key $x$. The output is $i$ such that $x=A[i]$ or 0 if does not exist.

    Naturally, there are $n+1$ possible outputs. The information thoery lower bound for this problem is then
    $$
    C(P) \geq \lceil \log_2 (n+1) \rceil
    $$
\end{example}
