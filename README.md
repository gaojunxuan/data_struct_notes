# Notes on Data Structures and Analysis

These notes cover data structures and analysis. They should include most data structures taught at undergraduate level, along with a few advanced topics. The notes are based on the lectures from CSC265 at the University of Toronto. It is an undergraduate course on designing, analyzing, and comparing data structures. The materials are accompanied with rigorous proofs and analysis. I also consulted the textbook Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and various other sources listed in the bibliography section of the notes.

## Topics Covered

The notes cover the following topics:

- Abstract data types
- Binary search tree and balanced search trees (red-black tree, AVL, B-tree)
- Augmented data structures (order statistics, interval tree)
- Priority queue and heap (binary heap, binomial heap, Fibonacci heap)
- Average case and probabilistic analysis
- Randomized algorithms
- Amortized analysis
- Amortized data structures (dynamic array, scapegoat tree, splay tree)
- Hashing, open addressing, and Bloom filter
- Disjoint sets (union-find) and analysis
- Lower bounds and problem complexity (decision tree model, information theory, adversary argument, and reduction)
- Graph representations
- Elementary graph algorithms: BFS and DFS
- Single-source shortest path on a graph

To understand the materials, one should be familiar with theory of computation, inductive proofs and other proof techniques, complexity and correctness proof of recursive and iterative algorithms.

## Accuracy

I will try my best to ensure the accuracy of the contents. However, unlike my previous notes on data structure and theory of computation, these notes contain some personal opinions and interpretations that could be inaccurate or outright erroneous. If you find any errors, please let me know.

There are a lot of proofs in the notes. For most of them, the proof that I presented is not the only valid proof. There could be multiple valid ways to prove the same thing. But if you do believe that I made an error in one of the proofs, let me know too.

## Using these notes

Feel free to use these notes as reference, but if you are taking CSC265 or any other data structure courses at other universities, I still highly recommend that you keep your own notes. Because of the rigorous nature of CSC265, some may find the proofs hard to understand or counterintuitive. These notes should be a companion of your notes, not a substitute.

## Contribute

I have finished most of the notes, with a few chapters missing (namely, lower bound, scapegoat tree, splay tree, Fibonacci heap, Bloom filter) and incomplete (randomization, and maybe some other chapters).

Any contribution is appreciated. If you want to contribute: edit, improve, finish incomplete chapters, or add new contents, feel free to chime in at any time. Please make sure to cite your sources as necessary.
